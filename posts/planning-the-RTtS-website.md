# What is it going to acomplish?
This is going to acomplish a link between the 6502 Computer and a live stream & form on my website.

# What will I need to pull this off?
* 6502 computer
* Raspberry Pi
* Webcam
* 3D printed mount
* Backend API
* USB to serial port adapter
* OBS
* Raspbian
* Website
* Youtube Channel

# What will the flow look like
## Website -> Computer
Begin -> Website -> Backed API -> USB to SP adapter -> 6502 Computer -> End

## Computer -> Livestream -> Website
Begin -> Webcam -> RPI -> OBS -> Youtube -> Website

**The rest is kinda up in the air tbh**
